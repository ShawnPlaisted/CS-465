## Project Overview
This project marks the first stage of developing the Travlr Getaways full stack web application using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js). The goal of this module is to create a working shell of the customer-facing web application that renders static HTML content using Node.js and the Express framework.  

This foundational setup ensures that the environment is properly configured and ready for integration of server-side logic, database connections, and Angular components in later modules. By completing this portion, I verified that my Node.js runtime, Express framework, and file architecture function correctly to serve static content and respond to basic requests.

## Objectives
- **Functionality:** Build a Node.js and Express-based web server capable of serving static content.  
- **Architecture:** Correctly structure the Express project by placing HTML, CSS, and image files inside the `/public` directory.  
- **Testing:** Confirm through browser and JSON endpoint verification that the server renders pages correctly and responds to requests.
